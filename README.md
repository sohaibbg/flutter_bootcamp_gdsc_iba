Rough Draft 1

1. Installation and setup (flutter, vs code, scrcpy)
2. Hierarchy all the way from the top to the Build function
Concept: Set a foundation to understand state and what is happening when their code runs
2. Widget UI Layout Process
Concept: Set a foundation to understand widget sizing and why their widgets exceed bounds
3. Layout Widgets (column, row, gridview, listview, wrap)
Concept: be able to "draw" on the canvas
4. basic widgets (bnavbar, hamburger menu, appbar), attributes
Concept: start being able to mock Figma etc. designs
5. Textfield, validation and controllers very shortly
6. Shapes, button colors, splash/material rendering, CropRRect
Concept: understand flutter pain points they may get stuck on later and good documentation is not available
7. Make a list of things they don't understand for personal exploration
Concept: try to make them think critically about what and where they'll need to seek help, and see patterns of how they seek for help, e.g. drawer animation
8. Flutter sliverappbar widget of the week video
Concept: expose them to a brilliant self-help and discovery resource. see how intimidated they are of what they don't know, and how willing they are to get their hands dirty and experiment even when confused. encourage getting hands dirty.
9. Navigation across pages without foundation or explanation
Concept: be able to open or close pages. read for foundation by self, provided resources.
